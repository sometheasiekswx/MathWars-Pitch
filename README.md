## MathWars Pitch Website

Visit the live site here [MathWars Pitch](https://sometheasiekswx.github.io/MathWars-Pitch/SIDSIESD1901-A1-Project-Plan.html).
This was my website for the SIT120 (Responsive Web Application) assingment 1. 

I tried to make this website accessible to the hearing impaired, which was not a requirement of my assingment, but something I thought was cool to have and get used making.
