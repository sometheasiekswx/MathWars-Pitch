                            grammar checked before adding it here. I also used the CSS @media tags to adjust content
                            dynamically for different devices and orientations. Additionally, my document follows a
                            colour theory and even makes use of a downloaded font. Overall, this looks like something
                            made by a professional.

                            unique. As for secondary features, 11 were taken from apps in our competitor analysis while

                    MathWars is a free to use website designed to teach kids and teens that Math can be fun and
                    engaging. Students will be able to practice solving the many problems in Mathematics ranging from
                    easy to mind-boggling. Each successful solution will be rewarded with points; the harder the
                    question, the more points will be awarded when solved. This online platform aims to be community
                    driven, which means that anyone can set up their own questions with answers that others can try to
                    solve and gain points from. There are groups that the users can join to solve large problems
                    together to each earn more points than usual. The skills taught in MathWars will be very useful in
                    many different fields that involve complex problem solving.

                                The UI design of this site is very cartoon-like with a consistent theme of pirates. As
                                for the UX, it is not quite the best due to bugs. The graphics feel very dated
                                considering this app was released in late 2018. Other than that, the overall look and
                                feel can be quite appealing to the younger audience.

                                This feature unique only to MathWars and is what distinguishes my idea from the rest.
                                The reason I chose these 3 unique topics as the core component of MathWars is because
                                they are the 3 most crucial field of study that greatly impacts our world. All the
                                lessons and exercises will be suitable for middle to high-school students. At the start,
                                most of the resources will come from the internet, but over time they will be replaced
                                by original content.<br><br>
                                This is the core feature and should take the most time so the estimated completion time
                                is <em><b>50 hrs</b></em>.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>

                            <td>
                                Looking back at IXL, their biggest feature is the AI they employ to try to understand
                                the level of progress being made and to continuously give back relevant feedback based
                                on those analysis. This will make the app feel more personal as well as improve learning
                                as users can see exactly what the problem is and what needs to change. Setting up an AI
                                from scratch will take a very long time so I will use the open source AI built by OpenAI
                                and tweak it to match my needs. Google’s DeepMind also has some open source tools to
                                work with.<br><br>
                                Currently, I have only a base knowledge of how AI and machine learning works, so it is
                                hard to tell when this feature will finish, so the estimated completion time is

                                Brainly’s community platform is limited, which is why I want to build a better platform
                                that addresses user’s complaint about the Brainly platform such as adding delete, edit,
                                bio, timestamps, and account recovery options. Prodigy’s platform seems perfect, but it
                                is focused around the theme of games. Mine will have a more CodeWars/Twitter feel to it,
                                which should attract a more mature audience.<br><br>
                                Building a social platform will require learning additional languages like PHP, so the
                                estimated completion time is <em><b>50 hrs</b></em> (<em><b>20 hrs</b></em> learning &
                                <em><b>30 hrs</b></em> building).

                                Many people were impressive with how many built-in tools like scientific calculators and
                                unit-specific converters Math Ref was able add into their app, so I will do the same
                                with mine. These simple utilities are small, but I believe they will be very beneficial
                                to users. The extra tools have work seamlessly with the app itself for people to use it,
                                so that is what I will focus on. Specifically, I want to add an graphics, scientific,
                                and programming calculator, and a temperature and weight converter that works for both
                                the metric and imperial system.<br><br>
                                This should be the easiest feature for me to implement as I have already written
                                calculators and converters before, so the estimated completion time is <em><b>10

                                The way parents, kids, and friends can play against each other to solve Math problems is
                                one of the main points why King of Math Junior is so popular, that is why I want to copy
                                this feature from it. My version of the multiplayer mode will add a new system that pits
                                random players around the globe together. Not being limited to just friends and family
                                members should make multiplayer make fun and exciting to player since you will never
                                know who you might be up against. Additionally, I will to add more harder problems into
                                multiplayer to get players thinking harder.<br><br>
                                This feature is probably very hard to one developer to implement since I assume it will
                                involve setting up multiple servers around the world. Luckily, there is AWS (Amazon Web
                                Services), which I can rent to set up the infrastructure needed, not to mention the
                                setup required. Since I am quite new to this field, I think this will take a lot of
                                research to do right, so the estimated completion time is <em><b>28 hrs</b></em>.

                                Both Brainly and Photomath is something that I would also because it actually helps you
                                with real world tests. I would love to have my application cover popular tests such as
                                the SATs, PSATs, and ACTs. Additionally, MathWars will also cover exams from countries
                                like Australia and the UK. I want to note that this app only helps out with the
                                Mathematics section the tests.<br><br>
                                I think it will be relatively easy to find the previous iterations of popular exams and
                                use those as a basis for learning, so the estimated completion time is <em><b>5

                                Personally, I love apps that have a dark mode and I know many tech enthusiasts share my
                                sentiment. None of the apps mentioned have this feature so I think adding this amazing,
                                yet simple feature should make me stand out. It is not as simple as inverting the
                                colours, that actually looks horrible, but it is not that difficult as well if we just
                                follow a monochromatic or adjacent color theory for dark and light themes.<br><br>
                                Designing the colours is something I think I am decent at, meaning this feature will not
                                take too much time so the estimated completion time is <em><b>5 hrs</b></em>.

                                other apps on this list currently has this and the idea is instead of trying to sell
                                users products and services that might not be useful or beneficial to them, we try to
                                sell them actual products that will improve them like a pre-algebra textbook for someone
                                who is constantly struggling with that topic. This can lead to partnerships with
                                textbook publishing companies, which benefits everyone.<br><br>
                                The only problem with this is trying to convince book publishers do partnerships, so the
                                approximate time to complete this is unknown.

                                The last three apps on the competitor analysis list is cross-platform, but that is only
                                IOS and Android. I want to expand to Windows, Linux, and MacOS as well. Another thing is
                                MathWars will solve the problems Math Ref have regarding not being responsive for
                                certain orientations and devices.<br><br>
                                I do not think making an app responsive for many screens is hard, but making it
                                compatible with different OS is going to be a challenge, so the approximate time to
                                complete this is <em><b>10 hrs</b></em>.

                                Brainly’s ranking system is considered by users to be pretty good, so if I have more
                                time, I will focus on adding a comprehensive ranking system like the one found in
                                Brainly. I do not think I will make any changes; it will basically be a copy with a
                                different theme. Under the hood, there will be a database that holds all the information
                                of the users like their scores and ranking.<br><br>
                                I have to spend some time understanding how to properly and securely store data to make
                                a good ranking system, so the approximate time to complete this is <em><b>10

                                This is one following the footsteps of successful educational apps like Math Ref and
                                ALEKS. I really hope in the future I will be able to expand MathWars to cover Physics,
                                Accounting, and general Science education. There is a possibility that I will need to
                                create a twin app with a name that covers a broader topic if I want to go into subjects
                                like Art or History.<br><br>

                                every time of the day. Having MathWars work offline like Photomath by downloading most
                                of the resources while online can help people with no or slow internet connections like
                                those in rural area or those with poor families. I think this is the first secondary
                                feature I would like to work on because of its importance.<br><br>
                                Having an app download all the data while connected to the internet seems simple enough
                                so the approximate time to complete this is <em><b>2 hrs</b></em>.

                                Another feature from Photomath that most users find appealing is the scanning photo
                                feature. Currently, the scanning method and camera utilization of Photomath leaves some
                                people frustrated because of how slow it is and how often has issues. MathWar’s scanning
                                feature will try to be faster and less buggy than Photomath’s one.<br><br>
                                I think that by using Google Lens, I can quickly put together the functionality to scan
                                images an solving it is simply a matter of using software like Wolfram Alpha, so the

                                MathWars, I will use a similar monetization scheme as Prodigy Math Game, but I have try
                                to be as open about it as possible.<br><br>
                                I am not a good graphics designer, so I will hire one to draw everything if this app is
                                really successful.

                                The 24/7 support from real staff at Brainly has is hard to reproduce for smaller apps
                                like MathWars. Instead, I want to try to create an automatic chat bot that can answer
                                questions accurately. I will use that until I can afford staff.<br><br>

                                By expanding to support more languages like Photomath, MathWars will be able to appeal
                                to more foreign users. I can translate the whole app into Khmer, but for other languages
                                I will need to hire translators or find friends willing to help. I will try to use
                                Google Translate from English to Khmer and correct any mistakes.<br><br>

                                Kids Mode will introduce kindergarten and primary school Mathematics materials so that
                                children can also use MathWars. To add lower level material, I will read some K-6 books
                                and add lessons based on what I see. I will also use MathLand to learn some of its
                                approaches to kids since they do it so well.<br><br>
                                This feature will be super easy to
                                add, so the approximate time to complete this is <em><b>2 hrs</b></em>.

                                Following great educational apps like ALEKS and Monkey Math School Sunshine, the feature
                                that customizes lessons to suit the user’s skill is invaluable. To add this, I will need
                                to either hard code it in or use AI. I am more interested in trying AI, so that might be
                                my approach.<br><br>
                                After the AI Analysis & Monitoring Tools, I should have learnt
                                enough about AI to be able to complete this feature quickly, so the approximate time to
                                complete this is <em><b>2 hrs</b></em>.

                                This is the most ambitious feature I want in the future as it will include university
                                level courses on Mathematics, Computer Science, and Engineering. Brainly is a good
                                example of an educational that is still relevant when a user reaches university.
                                MathWars university content will need to be reviewed by actual professors to ensure they
                                are up to the right standard.<br><br>
                                To add college level courses, I believe it will be
                                very time consuming, so the approximate time to complete this is <em><b>75 hrs</b></em>.

                    MathWars will have static game data containing information related to the user’s name, age, date
                    of birth, home address, and ID number:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em><b>Name</b></em>: the datatype of name is <em><b>String</b></em> because names are “Tom
                        Jerry” or “Somethea which fits perfectly into a string.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em><b>Age & ID No.</b></em>: the datatype for these two is a <em><b>Number</b></em> because
                        ages are 23 or 54 a increase by one every year. Number is good for age and ID because we can
                        perform Mathematical operations on it like plus and minus. Ages can be increased by one every
                        year and unique IDs can be generated from increasing the highest ID number by one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em><b>Date Of Birth & Address</b></em>: I chose the datatype for the date of birth to be an
                        <em><b>Object</b></em> rather than a string because with strings, the format might not be
                        consistent unlike objects which will always have the keys “day”, “month”, and “year” followed by
                        a semi-colon “:” and its value in string.

                        name and description will be strings whereas the page number will be a number type.

                    <li>
                        <em><b>Cash</b></em>: A <em><b>Number</b></em> because it is easier to increase or decrease the
